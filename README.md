This is an example code for a text chat that uses sockets. This code will include a server and a client, as well as the ability to send messages to "secret" rooms.
How to use it:
1. Run the file "server.py".
2. Run the file "client.py" in several copies.

The Goal of the project is to create a platform for secure communication that will ensure:
1. Anonymity: Users can communicate without having to register.
2. Security: The possibility of creating closed rooms for communication.
3. Ease of use: Intuitive interface and easy to use.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
To implement the project, I used the Python programming language and a library for working with sockets. 
This allows you to create a server that will handle incoming connections from clients and transfer messages between them.

Server code: The server accepts connections from clients and processes their messages. It also manages rooms, allowing users to create and join them:
python
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import socket
import threading

clients = []
rooms = {}

def handle_client(client_socket, addr):
    # Обработка клиента
    ...

def broadcast(message, client_socket):
    # Рассылка сообщений
    ...

def start_server():
    # Запуск сервера
    ...

start_server()

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Client Code: Clients connect to the server and can send messages. They can also join different rooms for socializing:
python
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import socket
import threading

def receive_messages(client_socket):
    # Получение сообщений
    ...

def send_messages(client_socket):
    # Отправка сообщений
    ...

def start_client():
    # Запуск клиента
    ...

start_client()

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


OPPORTUNITIES

As part of my project, users can:
• Connect to the server without registration.
• Create your own "secret" rooms for communication with limited access.
• Send text messages that will be visible only to the participants of the room.


CONCLUSION

In conclusion, I would like to note that my Anonymous Chat project offers users a safe and anonymous way to communicate. 
I am sure that such platforms can be useful for various communities where privacy and security of communication are important.
